# Deployment Fix for Static File Structure

## Quick Solution

To fix the deployment issue, run this command before deploying:

```bash
npm run build && node fix-deployment.js
```

## What This Fixes

The deployment was failing with this error:
```
Static deployment cannot find index.html file in the public directory 'dist'
Build process outputs HTML files to 'dist/public' but deployment expects them in 'dist' directory
```

## Why This Happens

1. **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend files to `dist/public/`
2. **Deployment**: Static deployment expects files in `dist/` 
3. **Server**: Production server looks for files in wrong location
4. **Configuration**: Core config files cannot be modified

## Available Solutions

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build && node fix-deployment.js
```

### Option 2: Comprehensive Build
```bash
node deploy-build.js
```

### Option 3: Existing Script
```bash
node scripts/build.js
```

## What Each Script Does

All scripts accomplish the same goal:
1. Build the application normally
2. Copy all files from `dist/public/` to `dist/`
3. Ensure `index.html` is in the root `dist/` directory
4. Preserve original file structure

## After Running the Fix

Your `dist/` directory will contain:
- `index.html` ✅ (Required for deployment)
- `assets/` ✅ (Required for deployment)  
- `index.js` ✅ (Server file)
- `public/` ✅ (Original build output)

## For Future Deployments

Always run one of the fix scripts before deploying to ensure files are in the correct location.
