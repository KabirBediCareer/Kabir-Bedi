# Deployment Fix for Build Output Structure

## Problem
The deployment was failing with the error:
```
Static deployment cannot find index.html file in the public directory 'dist'
Build process outputs HTML files to 'dist/public' but deployment expects them in 'dist' directory
```

## Root Cause
- Vite config builds frontend assets to `dist/public/` directory
- Replit deployment expects static files in `dist/` directory
- The configuration files (vite.config.ts, .replit) cannot be modified due to system restrictions

## Solution
Created post-build scripts that restructure the build output to match deployment expectations:

### Files Created:
1. `scripts/build.js` - Complete build process with file restructuring
2. `scripts/post-build.js` - Standalone post-build file restructuring script

### How It Works:
1. **Build Phase**: Vite builds to `dist/public/` as configured
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild creates server files in `dist/`
3. **Post-Build**: Scripts copy all files from `dist/public/` to `dist/` for deployment

### Usage:
```bash
# Option 1: Use the complete build script
node scripts/build.js

# Option 2: Run build manually then restructure
npm run build
node scripts/post-build.js
```

### File Structure After Fix:
```
dist/
├── index.html        # Copied from dist/public/
├── assets/          # Copied from dist/public/assets/
├── index.js         # Server build output
└── public/          # Original vite build output (preserved)
    ├── index.html
    └── assets/
```

## Implementation Status
✓ Created build scripts with proper error handling
✓ Made scripts executable
✓ Files will be copied to correct location for deployment
✓ Preserves original build structure for development
✓ Handles conflicts between server and frontend files

## Testing
The scripts can be tested by running:
```bash
node scripts/build.js
```

This will build the application and ensure files are properly structured for deployment.
